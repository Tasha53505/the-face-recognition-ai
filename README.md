This project was part of a UDEMY course where it has the ability to recognise faces with any image. It includes an extensive back-end as well as a beautifully designed front-end. In this project I learnt about: 
- Node.js 
- Express, 
- Postgres/SQL, 
- React, 
- Packages, 
- Heroku, 
- Bash 
- and JavaScript.
